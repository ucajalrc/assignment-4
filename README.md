# Heap Data Structures: Heapsort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and Priority Queue in Python

## Overview

This repository contains clear, beginner-friendly Python implementations of three classic sorting algorithms—Heapsort, Merge Sort, and Quicksort—as well as a fully functional max-heap-based Priority Queue for scheduling tasks. The repo also includes a benchmarking script to compare the performance of these sorting algorithms on various data types (random, sorted, and reverse).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the scripts from your terminal:

## File Descriptions

- `heapsort.py`: In-place implementation of Heapsort.
- `benchmark_sorts.py`: Compares the runtime of all three sorts.
- `priority_queue.py`: Contains the `ScheduledTask` and `TaskPriorityQueue` classes.
- `report.pdf` or `report.docx`: The detailed assignment report with analysis and code explanations.

### Note: `merge_sort.py` and `quicksort.py` are implemented in the benchmark file and not independently as it was not asked in the assignment. 


## How to run
```bash
    python <filename>
